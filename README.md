### vip-github-actions
## Why
Because we wanted to **centralized** all of our *actions* instead of just writing them manually inside each *repository*.  

## Actions
### Maven
This action will build and push the jar to the nexus.  

### PMD
This action will rate your code quality and make a percentage on that.
